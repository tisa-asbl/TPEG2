// The ULR location referencing method is a dynamic location referencing method (Universal Location Referencing) which aims to overcome the limits of TPEG-LOC (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) based on an open, royalty-free method. ULR offers a flexible method to fulfil needs of content providers and users in relevant domains. It aims to be really &ldquo;universal&rdquo;, designed for human centred assistance-devices as well as map-related devices like navigation systems. Therefore it supports human-understandable representations such as text as well as machine-processable coding for the map-matching process on on-board digital maps. The ULR method is specified inTISA specification SP13008.
